## Purpose

API Blog is a backend web project presented by [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/) within her [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).

In this chapter I learned API routes GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. With this challenge I took everything I learned and created this API Blog website.

## Technologies Used
